      <description>I gave a keynote talk at USENIX Workshop of Offensive Technologies, Baltimore, Maryland, 13 August 2018. The title and abstract are what I provided for the WOOT program, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for humanity!) I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to actually figure out a talk to match the title and abstract I provided.
 The history of security includes a long series of arms races, where a new technology emerges and is subsequently developed and exploited by both defenders and attackers.</description>
