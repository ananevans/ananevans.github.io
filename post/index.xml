      <description>Hannah Chen presented her paper on Pointwise Paraphrase Appraisal is Potentially Problematic at the ACL 2020 Student Research Workshop:
 The prevailing approach for training and evaluating paraphrase identification models is constructed as a binary classification problem: the model is given a pair of sentences, and is judged by how accurately it classifies pairs as either paraphrases or non-paraphrases. This pointwise-based evaluation method does not match well the objective of most real world applications, so the goal of our work is to understand how models which perform well under pointwise evaluation may fail in practice and find better methods for evaluating paraphrase identification models.</description>

      <description>This blog was started in January 2008, a bit over eight years after I started as a professor at UVA and initiated the research group. It was named after Thomas Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s cipher wheel, which has long been (and remains) one of my favorite ways to introduce cryptography.
  Figuring out how to honor our history, including Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s founding of the University, and appreciate his ideals and enormous contributions, while confronting the reality of Jefferson as a slave owner and abuser, will be a challenge and responsibility for people above my administrative rank.</description>

      <description>Finding Black-box Adversarial Examples with Limited Queries Black-box attacks generate adversarial examples (AEs) against deep neural networks with only API access to the victim model.
Existing black-box attacks can be grouped into two main categories:
  Transfer Attacks use white-box attacks on local models to find candidate adversarial examples that transfer to the target model.
  Optimization Attacks use queries to the target model and apply optimization techniques to search for adversarial examples.</description>

      <description>Xiao Zhang will present our work (with Saeed Mahloujifar and Mohamood Mahmoody) as a spotlight at NeurIPS 2019, Vancouver, 10 December 2019.
Recent theoretical results, starting with Gilmer et al.&amp;lsquo;s Adversarial Spheres (2018), show that if inputs are drawn from a concentrated metric probability space, then adversarial examples with small perturbation are inevitable.c The key insight from this line of research is that concentration of measure gives lower bound on adversarial risk for a large collection of classifiers (e.</description>

      <description>I had a chance to visit the White House for a Roundtable on Accelerating Responsible Sharing of Federal Data. The meeting was held under &amp;ldquo;Chatham House Rules&amp;rdquo;, so I won&amp;rsquo;t mention the other participants here.
   The meeting was held in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. We entered through the visitor&amp;rsquo;s side entrance. After a security gate (where you put your phone in a lockbox, so no pictures inside) with a TV blaring Fox News, there is a pleasant lobby for waiting, and then an entrance right into the Roosevelt Room.</description>

      <description>In preparing to cover Cantor&amp;rsquo;s proof of different infinite set cardinalities (one of my all-time favorite topics!) in our theory of computation course, I found various conflicting accounts of what Cantor originally proved. So, I figured it would be easy to search the web to find the original proof.
Shockingly, at least as far as I could find1, it didn&amp;rsquo;t exist on the web! The closest I could find was in Google Books the 1892 volume of the JÃ¤hresbericht Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung (which many of the references pointed to), but in fact not the first value of that journal which contains the actual proof.</description>

      <description>(Cross-post by Bargav Jayaraman)
With the recent advances in composition of differential private mechanisms, the research community has been able to achieve meaningful deep learning with privacy budgets in single digits. RÃ¨nyi differential privacy (RDP) is one mechanism that provides tighter composition which is widely used because of its implementation in TensorFlow Privacy (recently, Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) has shown a tighter analysis for low privacy budgets, but it was not yet available when we did this work).</description>

      <description>Brink News (a publication of the The Atlantic) published my essay on the risks of deploying AI systems.
   Artificial intelligence technologies have the potential to transform society in positive and powerful ways. Recent studies have shown computing systems that can outperform humans at numerous once-challenging tasks, ranging from performing medical diagnoses and reviewing legal contracts to playing Go and recognizing human emotions. 
Despite these successes, AI systems are fundamentally fragile â and the ways they can fail are poorly understood.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quoted in this article by Will Knight focused on the work Oasis Labs (Dawn Song&amp;rsquo;s company) is doing on privacy-preserving medical data analysis: How AI could save lives without spilling medical secrets, MIT Technology Review, 14 May 2019.
 &amp;ldquo;The whole notion of doing computation while keeping data secret is an incredibly powerful one,&amp;rdquo; says David Evans, who specializes in machine learning and security at the University of Virginia. When applied across hospitals and patient populations, for instance, machine learning might unlock completely new ways of tying disease to genomics, test results, and other patient information.</description>

      <description>Sam Havron (BSCS 2017) is quoted in an article in Wired on eradicating stalkerware:
 The full extent of that stalkerware crackdown will only prove out with time and testing, says Sam Havron, a Cornell researcher who worked on last year&amp;rsquo;s spyware study. Much more work remains. He notes that domestic abuse victims can also be tracked with dual-use apps often overlooked by antivirus firms, like antitheft software Cerberus. Even innocent tools like Apple&amp;rsquo;s Find My Friends and Google Maps&amp;rsquo; location-sharing features can be abused if they don&amp;rsquo;t better communicate to users that they may have been secretly configured to share their location.</description>

      <description>Samin Yasar presented our paper on Context-award Monitoring in Robotic Surgery at the 2019 International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR) in Atlanta, Georgia.
 Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has enabled procedures with increased precision and dexterity, but surgical robots are still open loop and require surgeons to work with a tele-operation console providing only limited visual feedback. In this setting, mechanical failures, software faults, or human errors might lead to adverse events resulting in patient complications or fatalities.</description>

      <description>Xiao Zhang and my paper on Cost-Sensitive Robustness against Adversarial Examples has been accepted to ICLR 2019.
Several recent works have developed methods for training classifiers that are certifiably robust against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations. However, these methods assume that all the adversarial transformations provide equal value for adversaries, which is seldom the case in real-world applications. We advocate for cost-sensitive robustness as the criteria for measuring the classifier&amp;rsquo;s performance for specific tasks.</description>

      <description>Bargav Jayaraman presented our work on privacy-preserving machine learning at the 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018) in Montreal.
Distributed learning (sometimes known as federated learning) allows a group of independent data owners to collaboratively learn a model over their data sets without exposing their private data. Our approach combines differential privacy with secure multi-party computation to both protect the data during training and produce a model that provides privacy against inference attacks.</description>

      <description>I gave the Booz Allen Hamilton Distinguished Colloquium at the University of Maryland on Can Machine Learning Ever Be Trustworthy?.
 [Video](https://vid.umd.edu/detsmediasite/Play/e8009558850944bfb2cac477f8d741711d?catalog=74740199-303c-49a2-9025-2dee0a195650) &amp;middot; [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/evansuva/can-machine-learning-ever-be-trustworthy) 
 Abstract Machine learning has produced extraordinary results over the past few years, and machine learning systems are rapidly being deployed for critical tasks, even in adversarial environments. This talk will survey some of the reasons building trustworthy machine learning systems is inherently impossible, and dive into some recent research on adversarial examples.</description>

      <description>Engineering and Technology Magazine (a publication of the British [Institution of Engineering and Technology]() has an article that highlights adversarial machine learning research: Artificial intelligence: the new ghost in the machine, 10 October 2018, by Chris Edwards.
  Although researchers such as David Evans of the University of Virginia see a full explanation being a little way off in the future, the massive number of parameters encoded by DNNs and the avoidance of overtraining due to SGD may have an answer to why the networks can hallucinate images and, as a result, see things that are not there and ignore those that are.</description>

      <description>The New York Times has an article, How Game Apps That Captivate Kids Have Been Collecting Their Data about a lawsuit the state of New Mexico is bringing against app markets (including Google) that allow apps presented as being for children in the Play store to violate COPPA rules and mislead users into tracking children. The lawsuit stems from a study led by Serge Eglemanâs group at UC Berkeley that analyzed COPPA violations in childrenâs apps.</description>

      <description>I gave a keynote talk at USENIX Workshop of Offensive Technologies, Baltimore, Maryland, 13 August 2018. The title and abstract are what I provided for the WOOT program, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for humanity!) I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to actually figure out a talk to match the title and abstract I provided.
 The history of security includes a long series of arms races, where a new technology emerges and is subsequently developed and exploited by both defenders and attackers.</description>

 Earlier this week, 25 high school teachers â including 21 from Virginia â filled a glass-walled room in Rice Hall, sitting in high adjustable chairs at wheeled work tables, their laptops open, following a lecture with graphics about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace and trying to figure out how to pass the information on to a generation that seems to share the most intimate details of life online.</description>

      <description>I gave a keynote talk at the 1st Deep Learning and Security Workshop (co-located with the 39th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy). San Francisco, California. 24 May 2018

  
  
Abstract

 Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of research in security of machine learning and on adversarial examples in particular. Although this is in many ways a new and immature research area, the general problem of adversarial examples has been a core problem in information security for thousands of years.</description>

      <description>I spoke on Lessons from the Last 3000 Years of Adversarial Examples at Huaweiâs Strategy and Technology Workshop in Shenzhen, China, 15 May 2018.    We also got to tour Huawei&amp;#8217;s new research and development campus, under construction about 40 minutes from Shenzhen. It is pretty close to Disneyland, with its own railroad and villages themed after different European cities (Paris, Bologna, etc.).
