      <description>Sam Havron (BSCS 2017) is quoted in an article in Wired on eradicating stalkerware:
 The full extent of that stalkerware crackdown will only prove out with time and testing, says Sam Havron, a Cornell researcher who worked on last year&amp;rsquo;s spyware study. Much more work remains. He notes that domestic abuse victims can also be tracked with dual-use apps often overlooked by antivirus firms, like antitheft software Cerberus. Even innocent tools like Apple&amp;rsquo;s Find My Friends and Google Maps&amp;rsquo; location-sharing features can be abused if they don&amp;rsquo;t better communicate to users that they may have been secretly configured to share their location.</description>
