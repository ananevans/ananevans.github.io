      <description>I chaired the committee to select Test-of-Time Awards for the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy symposia from 1995-2006, which were presented at the Opening Section of the 41st IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

      <title>White House Visit</title>

      <description>I had a chance to visit the White House for a Roundtable on Accelerating Responsible Sharing of Federal Data. The meeting was held under &amp;ldquo;Chatham House Rules&amp;rdquo;, so I won&amp;rsquo;t mention the other participants here.
   The meeting was held in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. We entered through the visitor&amp;rsquo;s side entrance. After a security gate (where you put your phone in a lockbox, so no pictures inside) with a TV blaring Fox News, there is a pleasant lobby for waiting, and then an entrance right into the Roosevelt Room.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice</title>

      <description>(Cross-post by Bargav Jayaraman)
With the recent advances in composition of differential private mechanisms, the research community has been able to achieve meaningful deep learning with privacy budgets in single digits. Rènyi differential privacy (RDP) is one mechanism that provides tighter composition which is widely used because of its implementation in TensorFlow Privacy (recently, Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) has shown a tighter analysis for low privacy budgets, but it was not yet available when we did this work).</description>

      <description>Bargav Jayaraman presented our paper on Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice at the 28th USENIX Security Symposium in Santa Clara, California.

&amp;mdash; Lea Kissner (@LeaKissner) August 17, 2019   Also, great to see several UVA folks at the conference including:
 Sam Havron (BSCS 2017, now a PhD student at Cornell) presented a paper on the work he and his colleagues have done on computer security for victims of intimate partner violence.</description>

      <guid>//uvasrg.github.io/google-security-and-privacy-workshop/</guid>
      <description>I presented a short talk at a workshop at Google on Adversarial ML: Closing Gaps between Theory and Practice (mostly fun for the movie of me trying to solve Google&amp;rsquo;s CAPTCHA on the last slide):
 Getting the actual screencast to fit into the limited time for this talk challenged the limits of my video editing skills.
 I can say with some confidence, Google does donuts much better than they do cookies!</description>

      <title>NeurIPS 2018: Distributed Learning without Distress</title>
      <link>//uvasrg.github.io/neurips-2018-distributed-learning-without-distress/</link>

      <guid>//uvasrg.github.io/neurips-2018-distributed-learning-without-distress/</guid>
      <description>Bargav Jayaraman presented our work on privacy-preserving machine learning at the 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018) in Montreal.
Distributed learning (sometimes known as federated learning) allows a group of independent data owners to collaboratively learn a model over their data sets without exposing their private data. Our approach combines differential privacy with secure multi-party computation to both protect the data during training and produce a model that provides privacy against inference attacks.</description>

      <description>Three SRG posters were presented at USENIX Security Symposium 2018 in Baltimore, Maryland:
 Nathaniel Grevatt (GDPR-Compliant Data Processing: Improving Pseudonymization with Multi-Party Computation) Matthew Wallace and Parvesh Samayamanthula (Deceiving Privacy Policy Classifiers with Adversarial Examples) Guy Verrier (How is GDPR Affecting Privacy Policies?, joint with Haonan Chen and Yuan Tian)  
         There were also a surprising number of appearances by an unidentified unicorn:</description>

      <description>I helped organize a summer camp for high school teachers focused on cybersecurity, led by Ahmed Ibrahim. Some of the materials from the camp on cryptography, including the Jefferson Wheel and visual cryptography are here: Cipher School for Muggles.
 


Cybersecurity Goes to Summer Camp. UVA Today. 22 July 2018. [archive.org]
 Earlier this week, 25 high school teachers – including 21 from Virginia – filled a glass-walled room in Rice Hall, sitting in high adjustable chairs at wheeled work tables, their laptops open, following a lecture with graphics about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace and trying to figure out how to pass the information on to a generation that seems to share the most intimate details of life online.</description>
