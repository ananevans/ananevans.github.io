      <description>In Spring 2020, I developed and delivered online guest lectures for a group of second graders.
We started with a lesson in formulas for areas. We used cuting and rearranging methods to deduce the formulas for area of rectangles, parallelograms and triangles (pptx, Video).
We continued our exploration of geometry with the Pythagorean theorem. We explored a cut and rearrange proof (pptx).
We concluded our explorations with the construction of natural numbers based on Peano&amp;rsquo;s Axioms.</description>
