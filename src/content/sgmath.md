In Spring 2020, I developed and delivered online guest lectures for a group of second graders.

We started with a lesson in formulas for areas. We used cuting and rearranging methods to deduce the formulas for area of rectangles, parallelograms and triangles ([pptx](//ananoraevans.org/SecondGradeMath/Areas.pptx), [Video](https://youtu.be/FcSiPP28G34)).

We continued our exploration of geometry with the Pythagorean theorem. We explored a cut and rearrange proof ([pptx](//ananoraevans.org/SecondGradeMath/Pythagorean%20Theorem.pptx)).

We concluded our explorations with the construction of natural numbers based on Peano's Axioms. First, I explained the notion of axiom, then explained Peano's axioms ([pptx](//ananoraevans.org/SecondGradeMath/PeanosAxioms.pptx)), and finished with a proof by induction ([pptx](//ananoraevans.org/SecondGradeMath/ProofPeanosAxioms.pptx)).
