In Spring 2020, I developed and delivered online guest lectures for a group of second graders.

We started with a lesson in formulas for areas. We used cuting and rearranging methods to deduce the formulas for area of rectangles, parallelograms and triangles ([<a href="http://ananevans.github.io/SecondGradeMath/Areas.pptx">pptx</a>], [<a href="https://youtu.be/FcSiPP28G34">Video</a>]).

We continued our exploration of geometry with the Pythagorean theorem. We explored a cut and rearrange proof ([<a href="http://ananevans.github.io/Pythagorean%20Theorem.pptx">pptx</a>]).

We concluded our explorations with the construction of natural numbers based on Peano's Axioms. First, I explained the notion of axiom, then explained Peano's axioms, and finished with a proof by induction ([<a href="http://ananevans.github.io/PeanosAxioms.pptx">pptx</a>], [<a href="http://ananevans.github.io/ProofPeanosAxioms.pptx">pptx</a>]).
