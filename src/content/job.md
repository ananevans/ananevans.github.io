I am looking for a teaching position in the Charlotetsville-Albemarle area in a middle school or high school.

After graduation in May 2022, I will earn a Virginia teaching licence for secondary mathematics education, with an endorsement in Computer Science. Because I hold a Master in Computer Science and a Master of Arts in Mathematics degrees, I am qualified to teach dual-enrollment classes.
