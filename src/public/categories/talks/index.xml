      <description>I was honored to particilate in a panel at an event on Adult Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence that was run by The Great Courses as a fundraiser for the Academy of Hope, an adult public charter school in Washington, D.C.
I spoke first, following a few introductory talks, and was followed by Nicole Smith and Ellen Scully-Russ, and a keynote from Dexter Manley, Super Bowl winner with the Washington Redskins.</description>

      <title>FOSAD Trustworthy Machine Learning Mini-Course</title>

      <description>I taught a mini-course on Trustworthy Machine Learning at the 19th International School on Foundations of Security Analysis and Design in Bertinoro, Italy.
 Slides from my three (two-hour) lectures are posted below, along with some links to relevant papers and resources.

      <description>I presented a short talk at a workshop at Google on Adversarial ML: Closing Gaps between Theory and Practice (mostly fun for the movie of me trying to solve Google&amp;rsquo;s CAPTCHA on the last slide):
 Getting the actual screencast to fit into the limited time for this talk challenged the limits of my video editing skills.
 I can say with some confidence, Google does donuts much better than they do cookies!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back from a very interesting Workshop on Federated Learning and Analytics that was organized by Peter Kairouz and Brendan McMahan from Google&amp;rsquo;s federated learning team and was held at Google Seattle.
For the first part of my talk, I covered Bargav&amp;rsquo;s work on evaluating differentially private machine learning, but I reserved the last few minutes of my talk to address the cognitive dissonance I felt being at a Google meeting on privacy.</description>

      <description>I had the privilege of speaking at the JASON Spring Meeting, undoubtably one of the most diverse meetings I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of with talks on hypersonic signatures (from my DSSG 2008-2009 colleague, Ian Boyd), FBI DNA, nuclear proliferation in Iran, engineering biological materials, and the 2020 census (including a very interesting presentatino from John Abowd on the differential privacy mechanisms they have developed and evaluated). (Unfortunately, my lack of security clearance kept me out of the SCIF used for the talks on quantum computing and more sensitive topics).</description>

      <title>Can Machine Learning Ever Be Trustworthy?</title>

      <description>I gave the Booz Allen Hamilton Distinguished Colloquium at the University of Maryland on Can Machine Learning Ever Be Trustworthy?.
 [Video](https://vid.umd.edu/detsmediasite/Play/e8009558850944bfb2cac477f8d741711d?catalog=74740199-303c-49a2-9025-2dee0a195650) &amp;middot; [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/evansuva/can-machine-learning-ever-be-trustworthy) 
 Abstract Machine learning has produced extraordinary results over the past few years, and machine learning systems are rapidly being deployed for critical tasks, even in adversarial environments. This talk will survey some of the reasons building trustworthy machine learning systems is inherently impossible, and dive into some recent research on adversarial examples.</description>

      <description>I gave a keynote talk at USENIX Workshop of Offensive Technologies, Baltimore, Maryland, 13 August 2018. The title and abstract are what I provided for the WOOT program, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for humanity!) I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to actually figure out a talk to match the title and abstract I provided.
 The history of security includes a long series of arms races, where a new technology emerges and is subsequently developed and exploited by both defenders and attackers.</description>

      <description>I gave a keynote talk at the 1st Deep Learning and Security Workshop (co-located with the 39th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy). San Francisco, California. 24 May 2018

  
  
Abstract

 Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of research in security of machine learning and on adversarial examples in particular. Although this is in many ways a new and immature research area, the general problem of adversarial examples has been a core problem in information security for thousands of years.</description>

      <description>I spoke on Lessons from the Last 3000 Years of Adversarial Examples at Huaweiâ€™s Strategy and Technology Workshop in Shenzhen, China, 15 May 2018.    We also got to tour Huawei&amp;#8217;s new research and development campus, under construction about 40 minutes from Shenzhen. It is pretty close to Disneyland, with its own railroad and villages themed after different European cities (Paris, Bologna, etc.).
